# ESP32-CW
ESP32 generate CW (Morse) ; Text to be converted in Morse, is written in an android application  using Bluetooth connectio 
Tis text is forwarded to an ESP32 board connected to a buzzer. Any ESP32 board can be used, GPIO pins for LED and Buzzer must be modified in Arduino software

esp32_ble_X_CW.ino   : software for ESP32 DEVKIT MH-ET-LIVE board ( approx 6â‚¬ ) a buzzer is attached to GPIO pin 22 and LED pin 2 is also used (to be compiled with Arduino IDE with ESP32 support)

BLE_ESP32_CW_V1.aia : source to AppInventor2 . Can be used to modifie apk file
BLE_ESP32_CW_V1.apk : For android smartphone compatible with android 5.0 and upper

Nota: To install ESP32 support in Arduino IDE follow these instructions https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md
